You might also hear this referred to as cluster analysis because of the way this method works. Using a clustering algorithm means you're going to give the algorithm a lot of input data with no labels and let it find any groupings in the data it can.\n\nThose groupings are called clusters. A cluster is a group of data points that are similar to each other based on their relation to surrounding data points. Clustering is used for things like feature engineering or pattern discovery.\n\n**When you're starting with data you know nothing about, clustering might be a good place to get some insight.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. Types of clustering algorithms\nThere are different types of clustering algorithms that handle all kinds of unique data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.1. Density-based\nIn density-based clustering, data is grouped by areas of high concentrations of data points surrounded by areas of low concentrations of data points. Basically the algorithm finds the places that are dense with data points and calls those clusters.\nThe great thing about this is that the clusters can be any shape. You aren't constrained to expected conditions.\nThe clustering algorithms under this type don't try to assign outliers to clusters, so they get ignored.\n\nDensity-based clustering connects areas of high example density into clusters. This allows for arbitrary-shaped distributions as long as dense areas can be connected. These algorithms have difficulty with data of varying densities and high dimensions. Further, by design, these algorithms do not assign outliers to clusters.\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334279038/figure/fig5/AS:960330599514121@1605972065828/Density-based-clustering-techniques-DBSCAN_Q320.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.2. Distribution-based\nWith a distribution-based clustering approach, all of the data points are considered parts of a cluster based on the probability that they belong to a given cluster.\nIt works like this: there is a center-point, and as the distance of a data point from the center increases, the probability of it being a part of that cluster decreases.\nIf you aren't sure of how the distribution in your data might be, you should consider a different type of algorithm.\n\nThis clustering approach assumes data is composed of distributions, such as Gaussian distributions. In Figure 3, the distribution-based algorithm clusters data into three Gaussian distributions. As distance from the distribution's center increases, the probability that a point belongs to the distribution decreases. The bands show that decrease in probability. When you do not know the type of distribution in your data, you should use a different algorithm.\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332053160/figure/fig2/AS:741417534107649@1553779123709/Distribution-model-of-clustering.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.3.

Consider removing or clipping outliers before clustering.\n- Scaling with number of dimensions.\n   - As the number of dimensions increases, a distance-based similarity measure converges to a constant value between any given examples.

It also requires more computational power because the nearest neighbour queries are more complicated than radius queries in DBSCAN.\n- **Fewer Parameters :** The OPTICS clustering technique does not need to maintain the epsilon parameter and is only given in the above pseudo-code to reduce the time taken.

Fuzzy Analysis Clustering","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a data clustering technique in which a data set is grouped into N clusters with every data point in the dataset belonging to every cluster to a certain degree. For example, a data point that lies close to the center of a cluster will have a high degree of membership in that cluster, and another data point that lies far away from the center of a cluster will have a low degree of membership to that cluster.\n\nThe fcm function performs FCM clustering. It starts with a random initial guess for the cluster centers; that is the mean location of each cluster. Next, fcm assigns every data point a random membership grade for each cluster. By iteratively updating the cluster centers and the membership grades for each data point, fcm moves the cluster centers to the correct location within a data set and, for each data point, finds the degree of membership in each cluster. This iteration minimizes an objective function that represents the distance from any given data point to a cluster center weighted by the membership of that data point in the cluster.\n\nThis algorithm follows the fuzzy cluster assignment methodology of clustering. The working of FCM Algorithm is almost similar to the k-means – distance-based cluster assignment – however, the major difference is, as mentioned earlier, that according to this algorithm, a data point can be put into more than one cluster. \n\n![](https://es.mathworks.com/help/examples/fuzzy/win64/fcmdemo_codepad_01.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.10.1.
