    "### What is meant by hyperparameter tuning?\n",
    "In machine learning, **hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm**. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned. The hyper-parameter tuning process is a tightrope walk to achieve a balance between underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting is when the machine learning model is unable to reduce the error for either the test or training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is hyperparameter tuning example?\n",
    "Some examples of model hyperparameters include: The penalty in Logistic Regression Classifier i.e. L1 or L2 regularization. The learning rate for training a neural network. The C and sigma hyperparameters for support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we use hyperparameter tuning?\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is an essential part of controlling the behavior of a machine learning model. If we don't correctly tune our hyperparameters, our estimated model parameters produce suboptimal results, as they don't minimize the loss function. This means our model makes more errors."

In this situation, trees added early are significant and trees added late are unimportant. *Vinayak and Gilad-Bachrach* proposed a new method to add dropout techniques from the deep neural net community to boosted trees, and reported better results in some situations - it s called dart. It drops trees in order to solve the over-fitting. Trivial trees (to correct trivial errors) may be prevented. Because of the randomness introduced in the training, expect the following few differences: Training can be slower than gbtree because the random dropout prevents usage of the prediction buffer. The early stop might not be stable, due to the randomness."
