A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned. The hyper-parameter tuning process is a tightrope walk to achieve a balance between underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting is when the machine learning model is unable to reduce the error for either the test or training set.\n","\n","### What is hyperparameter tuning example?\n","Some examples of model hyperparameters include: The penalty in Logistic Regression Classifier i.e. L1 or L2 regularization. The learning rate for training a neural network. The C and sigma hyperparameters for support vector machines.\n","\n","### Why do we use hyperparameter tuning?\n","Hyperparameter tuning is an essential part of controlling the behavior of a machine learning model. If we don't correctly tune our hyperparameters, our estimated model parameters produce suboptimal results, as they don't minimize the loss function. This means our model makes more errors."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f7b52c6c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013845,"end_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.321428","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.307583","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://blog.eduonix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hyperparameter.jpg\" />\n","</div>\n","\n","*eduonix*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"00c90d80","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013601,"end_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.348703","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.335102","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:200%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#d9d9d9;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500\"> XGBoost Parameters - Classification</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fac876f9","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015157,"end_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.378084","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-19T09:58:39.362927","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# 3.
